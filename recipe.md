In a bowl, mix water, salt, and sugar until combined. Add yeast, and let rest 5 minutes until yeast starts to foam.

Add flour and 2 tablespoons of oil, and mix thoroughly until a dough forms.

Remove the dough and use the remaining oil to cover the bowl.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and leave in a warm place for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).

Cut dough into 8 pieces and roll them out into thin ropes, twisting the two ends to form a pretzel shape.

Add baking soda to a large pot of water, and bring to a rolling boil. Boil each pretzel for 30 seconds per side.

Transfer pretzels to a baking sheet, brush with egg wash, and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.

Enjoy!
